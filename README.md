# AG-Log: An Adaptive Granularity Write-Ahead Logging System for Persistent Memory

This repository contains the Python implementation of the experiments described in the paper, *"AG-Log: An Adaptive Granularity Write-Ahead Logging System for Persistent Memory."* The project aims to reproduce the core ideas of the paper, which addresses the performance bottlenecks of traditional Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) on Persistent Memory (PM) through an adaptive logging strategy.

## Abstract

The emergence of Persistent Memory (PM) presents a transformative opportunity for data management systems, yet it also exposes a critical bottleneck in legacy software stacks: the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) protocol. When applied to PM, traditional disk-centric WAL mechanisms suffer from pathological **Write Amplification**, which degrades performance and reduces hardware endurance.

AG-Log proposes a novel adaptive granularity WAL system designed specifically for PM. The core of AG-Log is a lightweight dynamic decision engine that intelligently chooses between **fine-grained (delta) logging** for small updates and **coarse-grained (page) logging** for large writes on a per-operation basis.

-   For **small updates**, the system uses delta logging to record only the changes, minimizing write amplification.
-   For **large writes**, it switches to page logging for greater efficiency.

This implementation reproduces the experimental setup from the paper to compare the performance of AG-Log against traditional Page-WAL and a pure Delta-WAL across various workloads.

## The Core Concept: The Granularity Dilemma

When designing a logging system for Persistent Memory, developers face a fundamental trade-off:

1.  **Coarse-Grained (Page) Logging**:
    -   **Pros**: Simple to implement and efficient for large updates or full-page initializations.
    -   **Cons**: Suffers from pathological write amplification for small, frequent updates (e.g., modifying an account balance in an OLTP workload). For example, updating an 8-byte value might force a write of an entire 4KB page, resulting in a write amplification factor (WAF) of 512x.

2.  **Fine-Grained (Delta) Logging**:
    -   **Pros**: Directly solves the write amplification problem. The physical log size is proportional to the logical data change, maximizing performance and PM endurance for small updates.
    -   **Cons**: Each delta record requires its own metadata (e.g., transaction ID, offset, length). When a single transaction involves many small, scattered writes, this metadata overhead can become significant. For large updates, the cumulative cost of many delta records can exceed the cost of a single page log.

**AG-Log's solution** is its **dynamic decision engine**, which resolves this dilemma by choosing the optimal logging granularity at runtime based on the size of the write operation.

## Code Implementation Overview

The `ag_log_experiment.py` script contains the entire logic for the experiment, divided into several key components:

-   **`Config` Class**:
    Manages all configuration parameters for the experiment, such as page size (`PAGE_SIZE`), AG-Log's granularity threshold (`GRANULARITY_THRESHOLD`), and workload parameters.

-   **`EmulatedNVM` Class**:
    Simulates Persistent Memory using a memory-mapped file. It provides basic `read`, `write`, and `flush` operations and accurately tracks the total bytes written, which is crucial for calculating the **Write Amplification Factor (WAF)**.

-   **Logging Implementations (`PageWAL`, `DeltaWAL`, `AGLog`)**:
    -   `AbstractWAL`: An abstract base class defining a common interface for all WAL implementations.
    -   `PageWAL`: A traditional coarse-grained logger that records the entire 4KB page for every update.
    -   `DeltaWAL`: A fine-grained logger that records only the before-and-after images of the modified bytes.
    -   `AGLog`: The core implementation of the paper. When logging an update, it checks the size of the new data. If it's smaller than `GRANULARITY_THRESHOLD`, it uses delta logging; otherwise, it uses page logging.

-   **`PagedKVStore` Class**:
    A simplified page-based key-value store. All data modification operations (`put`) are first recorded using the configured WAL implementation.

-   **Workload Generators (`ycsb_workload`, `tpcc_simplified_workload`)**:
    Generates different test workloads as described in the paper:
    -   **YCSB-A (small)**: 50% reads / 50% updates with small values (64 bytes).
    -   **YCSB-B (small)**: 95% reads / 5% updates with small values (64 bytes).
    -   **YCSB-A (large)**: 50% reads / 50% updates with large values (1024 bytes).
    -   **TPC-C (Simplified)**: Simulates the core transactions of TPC-C, featuring a mix of large and small writes.

-   **Experiment Runner and Plotting**:
    The main `if __name__ == "__main__":` block orchestrates the entire experiment. It iterates through each WAL implementation and workload, collects performance metrics (throughput, latency, WAF, recovery time), and finally aggregates the results into a pandas DataFrame to generate plots.

## Interpreting the Results

The experimental data clearly reproduces the core findings of the paper:

-   **Write Amplification (WAF)**: In small-write workloads, the limitations of static policies are evident. For **YCSB-A (small)**, `PageWAL` exhibits a massive WAF of **64.14x**. This is even worse in the mixed-write **TPC-C** workload, where its WAF reaches **124.57x**. In contrast, both `DeltaWAL` and `AGLog` maintain a near-optimal WAF of approximately **2.2x-2.5x** in these scenarios, drastically reducing the physical write overhead.

-   **Throughput**: The reduced WAF directly translates to higher performance. In the write-intensive **YCSB-A (small)** workload, `DeltaWAL` and `AGLog` achieve significantly higher throughput (~77k ops/s) compared to `PageWAL` (~47k ops/s). This demonstrates the severe performance penalty of coarse-grained logging for small updates.

-   **Adaptivity**: The key to AG-Log's success is its ability to dynamically adapt its strategy.
    -   In the **YCSB-A (small)** workload, `AGLog`'s performance mirrors that of the optimal `DeltaWAL`.
    -   In the **YCSB-A (large)** workload, `AGLog` intelligently switches to page logging. Its WAF (**4.01x**) and throughput (**47.5k ops/s**) automatically converge with those of `PageWAL` (4.01x WAF, 46k ops/s), which is the superior strategy for large, page-aligned writes.
    
This proves that `AGLog` delivers robust, high performance by adopting the best logging strategy for any given workload, avoiding the pitfalls of a single, static policy.
